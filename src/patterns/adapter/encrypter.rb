# Now comes the catch: What happens if the data we want to secure happen to be
# in a string, rather than in a file? In this case, we need an object that looks like an open
# file—that supports the same interface as the Ruby IO object—on the outside, but
# actually gets its characters from the string on the inside. What we need is
# StringIOAdapter
