<body>
The general idea of the Template Method pattern is to
build an abstract base class with a skeletal method. This skeletal method (also called a
template method) drives the bit of the processing that needs to vary, but it does so by
making calls to abstract methods, which are then supplied by the concrete subclasses.</br>

Define an abstract base class with a master
method that performs the basic steps listed above, but that leaves the details of each
step to a subclass. With this approach, we have one subclass for each format.
