    <title>Builder Pattern</title>
</head>
<br>

The very simple idea behind the Builder pattern is that you take this kind of construction
logic and encapsulate it in a class all of its own.</br>
The builder class takes charge of assembling all of the components of a complex object. Each builder has an
interface that lets you specify the configuration of your new object step by step.</br> In a
sense, a builder is sort of like a multipart new method, where objects are created in
an extended process instead of all in one shot.
