    <title>Singleton pattern</title>

<body>
The motivation behind the Singleton pattern is very simple: There are some things
that are unique. Programs frequently have a single configuration file. It is not unusual
for a program to let you know how it is doing via a single log file. GUI applications
frequently have a one main window, and they typically take input from exactly one
keyboard. Many applications need to talk to exactly one database. If you only ever
have one instance of a class and a lot of code that needs access to that instance, it seems
silly to pass the object from one method to another. In this kind of situation, the GoF
suggest that you build a singletonâ€”a class that can have only one instance and that
provides global access to that one instance.</br>
